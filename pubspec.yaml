  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # rules and activating additional ones.
  flutter_lints: ^5.0.0

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/MyNavBar/
    - assets/icons/AppBar/
    - assets/icons/Profile/
    - assets/icons/Dashboard/
    - assets/icons/tabBar/
    - assets/icons/leads/
    - assets/icons/chats/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    # - assets/audio/sender_voice_message.mp3
    # - assets/audio/receiver_voice_message.mp3
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gilroy
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Golos
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Golos-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Golos-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
          
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
